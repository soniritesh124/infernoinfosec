                        <p align="left">
                            Penetration Testing is something we call Security Check of your network or systems. It is the process of testing web applications and finding vulnerabilities before an attacker finds it.
                            An effective penetration test will usually involve a skilled team of hackers. You purposefully ensure that the hacker(s) don't have access to any source code, and ask them to try to gain access to your systems.The Process of Pentesting examines the assets (network, server, applications) for vulnerabilities â€“ the down side of a vulnerability scan is that false positives are frequently reported. This means it is required for sanitising of application input and output, especially on web applications.
